# WhatsApp-Analysis
Code that parses a .txt file of the desired chats exported from WhatsApp to plot the trends over the time by hour, day of the week, and year; and to generate the most frequently used word every month.<br>
I used it to analyze and discover the communication trends after graduating from 2-year program at college.<br>
Libraries used: numpy, pandas, matplotlib <br>
See examples of the images below:<br>

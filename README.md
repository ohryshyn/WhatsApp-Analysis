# WhatsApp-Analysis
<p>Code that parses a .txt file of the desired chats exported from WhatsApp to plot the trends over the time by hour, day of the week, and year; and to generate the most frequently used word every month.</p>
<p>I used it to analyze and discover the communication trends after graduating from 2-year program at college.</p>
<p>Libraries used: numpy, pandas, matplotlib </p>
